(0) Grep TODO and see if there is anything obvious that can be added to
the issue tracker.

(1) Annotate test suite: 
  - Each standalone file should have comments at the top indicating what
  is being tested.

  - If it is a bug fix, name it after the bug that is fixed.

  - Each directory should have a file named 'test.dir' that has comments
  indicating what is being tested.

(2) Fix subtyping to work with the current set of tests
  - Leave the wildcard escape in
  - Handle lower bound / upper bound etc

(3) Redo the runtime
  - Ugly OO code; just rewrite.

(4) Rewrite syntax to match up with paper. This includes..
  (1) Mindless syntax changes (?mode, snapshot)
  (2) Removing @mode<X> as a ModeValue, and instead looking up
  via an identifier etc.

(5) Pull the polyglot test suite into the ent test suite.
  (1) JL Tests
  (2) JL5 Tests
  (3) JL7 Tests

(6) See if we can fix the JL7 issue I was running into a while back. 
It has to do with the AST rewriting. We may need to extend polyglot
a little bit here.

(7) 1-6 gets us fairly stable, begin checking off issue tracker.
