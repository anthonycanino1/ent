Test suite documentation
------
Each "test" typically has its own directory containing all files needed for the test. The directory
serves as the top level package for the test that all files are part of. Tests consisting of a
single file should have comments at the top indicating what is being tested. Tests with multiple 
files should have a file named 'TEST' that has comments indicating what is being tested.

Inside each file, there is usually a short comment // Good or // Error! that pinpoints what should
fail. These exist solely for the reader. The pthScript performs the actual compilation and pattern
matching against compiler output.

Tests that contain "good" or "bad" in their name indicate whether they exist to check interesting
cases that are tough to compile successfully or are tough to type check successfully. Tests that
are not tagged with either are more straightforward.

Tests that contain "pass" or "fail" in their name indicate that these a predominately runtime
type system tests and should always compile. When run, a "pass" should complete silently, a "fail"
should throw a RuntimeException. 

Tests in the "extended" directory are full benchmarks that have been integrated as part of the test
suite. 

The "test.bash" script automatically fires of the eth harness and the run harness. Running the
test script with the extended option "-e or -extended" will run the extended harness. These tests
MUST be run before a commit but may be ignored while making smaller edits due to thier longer 
compiles.
