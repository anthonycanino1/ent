// main: B
// Test: Checks that snapshot passes at runtime if the snapshotted object returns a mode type
// within the snapshot bounds when: 
//  (1) a method mode type variable is used within said bounds passed from a 
//  method 2 levels away
//  (2) a class mode type variable is substituted into said method
//  (3) a second method mode type variable is substituted into said method

// Overall, this is checking that the ENT_Closure mechanism captures "parent"
// method mode type variables etc.
