// estream will be the first useful working panda code.

Nice small case study, goal is to...
  - Have EnergyOutputStream and EnergyInputStream be an interface that
    helps create an energy pathway.

  - Have BufferedEnergyOutputStream and BufferedEnergyInputStream wrap
    around BufferedOutputStream and BufferedInputStream to be able to
    plug energy mangaging code around java code.

  - Have EnergySockets be a wrapper around Sockets, thus demonstrating
    separate energy pathways.

A key note is right now when I really want modes to determine behavior,
not just interaction. Subclasses right now can enforce behavior to a 
specific mode, which is probably the natural way without unions 
(subclass and set X mode type var).
  - Good example to motivate mcases.
