// main: C
// Test: Checks that snapshot passes at runtime if the snapshotted object returns a mode type
// within the snapshot bounds when: 
//  (1) a class mode type variable is substituted into a method mode type variable
//  from another class.
//  (2) a second method mode type variable is substituted into said method

// Overall, this is checking that the ENT_Closure mechanism captures "parent"
// method mode type variables etc.
