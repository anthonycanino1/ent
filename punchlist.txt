-- Punchlist

1. Solve mcase resolve issue
   - When do we resolve an mcase? When to we return the translated array?
   - How do we allow initialization on mcases?

2. Add in mode subtyping proper to all the type system methods.

3. Add in mode subst types over arrays.

4. Optimization pass for snapshot. 
  - Semantic checking for what will always fail.
  - Removing extra check for range if it can never fail.
  - Switch this to be able to turn on and off to record the reduction in overhead.

5. Allow mode type variables to be returned inside attributor.

6. Add full mode type variable inference.

7. Handle JL5/JL codegen issues.

8. Cleanup TODOs.

9. Optimize mode subst with caching and equivalence to speed up compilation.

10. See about pulling out common codegen code into some sort of mini module
    to reuse.

11. Put together a test fixture for semantic checking, spend the minimum amount
    of time on it.
