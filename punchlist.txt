-- Punchlist

1. Add mode types on Array types.

2. Add mode types proper to inheritances.

3. Fix all cases of WARNING, each one indicates that there are parts of the type system that are missing.

4. Fix PANDA_Copy to properly clone methods. (DONE)
  - See commit notes, chose to add copy semantics to the language.

5. Add object bounds codegen to snapshot. (DONE)
  - See commit notes, context sensitivity added for ModeValues/SnapshotExpr.

6. Add some context sensitivity to mode values to change @mode<low> to simply be low.

7. Add mode type parameters to snapshot for resolution. (DONE)

8. Add mode type parameters code generation to table and update snapshot to handle this. (DONE)
  - Last part is fixing the way 'this' is handled inside a constructor.

9. Add in mcase typechecking.

10. Add in mcase codegen.

11. Add in mode subtyping proper (instead of forcing mode subst types to be equal).


String[][]@mode<low> s;

- Initial work
  - Get Array of (String@mode*>[]) working
  - Get mode of entire array String[]@mode<*> working
  - After that, we can figure out the obscurities of all cases,
    right now can force a multi dim array to only have one mode.


List<List<String>> s;

List<List<String@mode<*> >@mode<*> >@mode<*> s;
