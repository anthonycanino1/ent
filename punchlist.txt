12. IMPORTANT : Wildcard mode types placed on unannotated types need to create a wildcard mode type 
    FOR EACH mode type varaible of the base type.

    object oriented right now, could be cleaned up a little. This will end up being fixed when
    PandaMode.java is addressed (to properly communicate with the runtime).
