12. IMPORTANT : Wildcard mode types placed on unannotated types need to create a wildcard mode type 
    FOR EACH mode type varaible of the base type.

15. Look further into the way mode types are created and built (the partial ordering). Not very
    object oriented right now, could be cleaned up a little. This will end up being fixed when
    PandaMode.java is addressed (to properly communicate with the runtime).

16. The way preservation is checked on PandaClassTypes is not very object oriented. Probably should
    fix this.

17. Revist PandaLubType.c (grep TODO) and either perform a full erasue of mode types (for Set.retainAll)
    or implement a set that will use typeEquals for comparison and not equals.

18. Need to strengthen the relationship between the dynamic mode recv and interfaces / subclasses.

19. Finalize the way modesafe should work and implement the rest.
      - modesafe functions can only call other modesafe functions
      - modesafe functions cannot touch 'this' mcases
      - modesafe functions can not use snapshot (?)
