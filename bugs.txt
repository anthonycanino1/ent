List of bugs that are big issues, and need fixes.

(1) Object Saving
  - Need to get rid of the mcase hack that avoids having to properly track
  which objects need to be saved for the runtime. Right now we rely on
  heuristics.

(2) Battery Manager Android
  - If the Battery is needed during application Boot before the main
  activity is loaded, the current method will not work.

  It's possible that the current method will not work for any app that
  processes events in the background.

(3) Dynamic Mode Type Declaration
  - If we declare a class with the dynamic mode type, does that mean ALL
  instances of the class must have a dynamic mode type.

  Right now, I don't enforce this, but it causes issues with object saving.

(4) Object Mode Cases
  - We have a bug where mode cases that are created with objects do not
    compile. Looks like it has to do with lookup order of classes.
    Grep ENT-BUG on polyglot to uncomment helpful print statements.

(1) J7 Exceptions -> LUB Type
  - J7 exception handling is wrong, can't simply replace with the LUB type

List of bugs that have been encountered compiling benchmarks and external
applications that I was not able to isolate enough. Simply grep 'ENT-BUG'
on the benchmark.
