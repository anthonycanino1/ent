- Hierarchy of the mode substituted types is as follows. This needs to be tracked
  so we can do a proper refactor for what messages need to be forwarded to base
  types and what can be kept in super classes.

  Once that is done, we can add in submoding proper

  ModeSubstType
  |   (provide base forward for type system methods)
  |
  |__ ModeSubstPrimitiveType
  |
  |__ ModeSubstReferenceType
      |
      |__ ModeSubstArrayType
      |
      |__ ModeSubstClassType
      |   |
      |   |__ ModeSubstParsedClassType
      |   |
      |   |__ ModeSubstRawClass
      |   |
      |   |__ ModeSubstSubstClassType
      |
      |__ ModeSubstTypeVariable


- In general, the methods I care about are...
  - typeEqualsImpl
  - descendsFromImpl
  - isSubtypeImpl

  - class forward methods
  - class subst methods


- Unfortunately, it looks like the type methods need to be handled specifically,
  and can not simply be a forward to the base types.

  Not horrible, but needs some work now.
